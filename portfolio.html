    <h1><b>Why I'm taking this bootcamp:</b></h1>
    <p>
        <blockquote>The <em># 1</em> reason why I decided to take this course 
            is because I'm looking to get in to the world of sports 
        analytics, more specifically <strong>NFL</strong> analytics. I've followed 
        professional sports my whole life and even collected 
        memorabilia from a young age.  Growing up in Dallas, I'm a homer
        and root for the local professional teams.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>As my knowledge of the game grew, I became more
            and more interested in the game.  I initially went to a small 
            college out of high school that didn't have a football team.  
            I was lucky enough to be invited to an SEC game and immediately 
            fell in love with the atmosphere.  I went to LSU vs Alabama in 
             Baton Rouge.  Ironically, I transferred to Alabama.  Mind you, this 
             was before Saban was head coach at Bama.

    <p> When tracking different aspects of amateur and professional football, 
        I'll go to different websites to get different information on 
        <bold>recruiting</bold>, <bold>daily fantasy sports</bold>, 
        <bold>gambling sites to get the odds</bold>, and <bold>different 
        talking heads I've followed over the years</bold>.  Here are a few of the useful
        resources I use:
